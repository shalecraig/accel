/**
 * Callback called whenever a given gesture drops below the offset/length
 * threshold specified when the state is initialized.
 *
 * A simple accel_callback is as follows:
 *
 * const int my_callback(accel_state *state, int gesture_id, int offset_found, bool *reset_gesture) {
 *     int retval = ACCEL_SUCCESS;
 *     if (gesture_id == 1) {
 *         *reset_gesture = true;
 *         ...
 *     } else {
 *         logger->info("unrecognized gesture %i ", gesture_id);
 *         retval = ACCEL_MIN_RESERVED - 1;
 *     }
 *     return retval;
 * }
 *
 * For the callback method, the documentation is as follows:
 * @param  state            A non-NULL pointer to a state variable that holds
 *                          recording metadata.
 * @param  gesture_id       The identifier of the gesture that has been
 *                          triggered.
 * @param  offset_found   The offset of the triggered gesture_id to the
 *                          recorded gesture.
 * @param  reset_gesture    Setting reset_gesture to be true will result in the
 *                          gesture being reset after the callback is triggered,
 *                          and setting it to false will prevent the gesture
 *                          from being reset. No default value is promised.
 * @return int              Returns ACCEL_SUCCESS if successful. Values that are
 *                          not ACCEL_SUCCESS will cause the calling method to
 *                          immediately abort and proxy-return the value
 *                          returned by the callback.
 *                          Implementers wishing to return a custom value should
 *                          refer to the ACCEL_MIN_RESERVED definition inside
 *                          their implementations.
